# homework-portfolio
Made my name the center of attention when loading my website 
if page is minumized itll make a directory of the contents on the top right corner so you can see it with every size
I just used random pictures for my work since i dont have anything to showcase just yet 
it glows up just like the mock 
all of my contacts are direct links to contact me 
and my spotify 
my buttons are clickable 
I wanted it to be easy for me to go back and just fill things in so its easy to do that once i have more content
